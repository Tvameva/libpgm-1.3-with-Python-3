# libpgm-1.3-with-Python-3
libpgm 1.3 will have multiple errors when tried to use it with Python 3. Just replace the installed files with the files here and you must be good to go.

Just take the two zip files n unzip them. Replace with the existing folders.

Note: Do not delete your old folders, just remane them as filename_old.
